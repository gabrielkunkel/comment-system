- [X] Server compiles to TypeScript.
- [X] Server runs using Nodemon.
- [X] Using *concurrently*, TypeScript --watch and Nodemon runs at the same time, successfully compiling TypeScript and running server.
- [X] Test Hello World GraphQl implementation functional.
- [X] Add testing suite with working /graphql example using mocha, chai, and supertest.
- [X] Testing suite watches all src and test files and updates automatically.
- [X] Connect to local MongoDB with Mongoose.
- [X] Get basic passing test for GraphQL

### Create Mongoose/GraphQl API
#### Get passing test on...
- [X] A new comment will be added to the database and returned.
- [ ] A number of comments may be requested from the database.

...More to come as progress continues.
